        <p color="darkgreen">
            Diabetic retinopathy is a condition that may occur in people who have diabetes.
It causes progressive damage to the retina, the light-sensitive lining at the back of the
eye. Diabetic retinopathy is a serious sight-threatening complication of diabetes.
Diabetes interferes with the body's ability to use and store sugar (glucose).
The disease is characterized by too much sugar in the blood, which can cause
damage throughout the body, including the eyes. Over time, diabetes damages small
blood vessels throughout the body, including the retina. Diabetic retinopathy occurs
when these tiny blood vessels leak blood and other fluids. This causes the retinal tissue
to swell, resulting in cloudy or blurred vision. The condition usually affects both eyes.
The longer a person has diabetes, the more likely they will develop diabetic
retinopathy. If left untreated, diabetic retinopathy can cause blindness.<br><br>
Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy include:<br><br>
1. Seeing spots or floaters<br>
2. Blurred vision<br>
3. Having a dark or empty spot in the center of your vision<br>
4. Difficulty seeing well at night<br><br>
When people with diabetes experience long periods of high blood sugar, fluid can
accumulate in the lens inside the eye that controls focusing. This changes the curvature
of the lens, leading to changes in vision. However, once blood sugar levels are
controlled, usually the lens will return to its original shape and vision improves.<br>
Patients with diabetes who can better control their blood sugar levels will slow the
onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy. According to a 2018 American EyeQ Survey conducted by the AOA, nearly half of Americans didn't know whether
diabetic eye diseases have visible symptoms (often which the early stages of diabetic
retinopathy does not). The same survey found that more than one-third of Americans
didn't know a comprehensive eye exam is the only way to determine if a person's
diabetes will cause blindness, which is why the AOA recommends that everyone with
diabetes have a comprehensive dilated eye examination at least once a year. Early
detection and treatment can limit the potential for significant vision loss from diabetic
retinopathy. Treatment of diabetic retinopathy varies depending on the extent of the
disease. People with diabetic retinopathy may need laser surgery to seal leaking blood
vessels or to discourage other blood vessels from leaking. Your Doctor of Optometry
might need to inject medications into the eye to decrease inflammation or stop the
formation of new blood vessels. People with advanced cases of diabetic retinopathy
might need a surgical procedure to remove and replace the gel-like fluid in the back of
the eye, called the vitreous. Surgery may also be needed to repair a retinal detachment.
This is a separation of the light-receiving lining in the back of the eye.<br><br>
If you are diabetic, you can help prevent or slow the development of diabetic
retinopathy by:<br><br>
1. Taking your prescribed medication<br>
2. Sticking to your diet<br>
3. Exercising regularly<br>
4. Controlling high blood pressure<br>
5. Avoiding alcohol and smoking<br>
